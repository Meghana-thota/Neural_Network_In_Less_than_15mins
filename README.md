# 🧠 Quick Neural Network in PyTorch - 15-Minute Challenge ⏳🔥

This repository contains a simple yet effective **Neural Network built in PyTorch** within **15 minutes** as a coding challenge! The model is designed for **image classification**.

## 📌 Features:
✔️ Built in **under 15 minutes** ⏱️  
✔️ Supports **MPS acceleration on Mac (M1/M2)**  
✔️ Uses **PyTorch `nn.Sequential()` for simplicity**  
✔️ Performs **image classification** with `Conv2D` layers  
✔️ Saves & loads trained models  

## 🏗️ Model Architecture:
- Convolutional layers (`Conv2D`)
- Activation functions (`ReLU`)
- Fully connected (`Linear`) layers
- **Training with `CrossEntropyLoss` & Adam optimizer**

## 🚀 Running the Model:
```python
python NN.py  # Run training
